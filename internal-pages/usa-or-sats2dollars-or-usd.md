My favorite way is to actually use Coinbase. Now that they implemented lightning...

* I just followed this tutorial here and it worked great: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/lightning](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/lightning)

Aother way is to use Breeze Wallet to take out sats and then do on-chain bitcoin into an exchnage like Binance.

* One thing to watch out for here is you need minimum 100,000 sats in your Breez Wallet to make an on-chain transfer, And you'll be hit with a larger fee than if you just used lightning: [https://doc.breez.technology/Introducing-Breez.html?highlight=btc%20address#on-chain-transactions](https://doc.breez.technology/Introducing-Breez.html?highlight=btc%20address#on-chain-transactions)
