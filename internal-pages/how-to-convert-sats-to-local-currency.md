# How-To: Convert Sats to Local Currency

In the following add a subpage below, to earn a bounty. See the USA example below. For the title use the example layout of \<flag emoji> \<country\_name> | Sats2\<currency\_name> | \<currency\_symbol> so e.g. "USA | Sats2Dollars | $"

We want to know how you can take your sats off LightningBounties (or any other lightning site). Bonus points: are there any ways in your local area you could use sats directly?
