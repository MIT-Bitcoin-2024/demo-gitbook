#### What are Sats (Satoshi‚Äôs)?

*   Simplest Explainer

    ~~Sats/Satoshi‚Äôs are a fraction of bitcoin, like cents are a fraction of dollar~~

    A ‚Äòsat‚Äô or ‚Äòsatoshi‚Äô is the smallest monetary unit of bitcoin. You can think of Satoshis in a similar way to the cents that make up a dollar.

A Sat or Satoshi is the smallest unit of account on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is named to honor the creator of Bitcoin called "Satoshi Nakamoto" which was his pseudonym.

You can see the Bitcoin unit of accounts here

[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units)

With millibits (mBTC) and Sats being the most common denomination in Bitcoin

1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC or 100,000,000 sats in 1 Bitcoin

[https://www.kraken.com/learn/satoshi-to-usd-converter](https://www.kraken.com/learn/satoshi-to-usd-converter)

1 USD = 1,617 sats at this moment (6/25/2024)

1 US penny = 16 sats at this moment (6/25/2024)

When people say "stacking sats" they literally mean accumulating more savings in Bitcoin.

In the future when Bitcoin is more stable and worth \~10 million usd = 1 BTC than you might see things like coffee shops selling a cup of coffee for 10-20 sats a cup and cars selling for 5 millibits for a car as examples of how they will be used in daily life.

If you are concerned about microtransactions or machine to machine microtxs don't worry as Bitcoin can be divided further into 1/1000 of a satoshi in a lightning payment channel

To clarify Divisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.

#### **How many Satoshi‚Äôs are in one Bitcoin?**

Each of the 21 million units of bitcoin that will ever exist can be broken down further into 100,000,000 satoshis.

<summary>Payment</summary>

A payment is a transaction that occurs on the lightning network. Payments are routed through lightning payment channels and are not recorded in the bitcoin blockchain.

<summary>Signature</summary>

Since a [private key](https://bitcoin.design/guide/glossary/#private-key) can be used to prove that the holder controls a specific address, it can therefore authorize transactions from the address. This is called a digital signature.

One of the most important activities of the bitcoin network is to verify that signatures are valid.

#### Public Key

A bitcoin address‚Äô public key can be derived from the private key. The address itself is a hash of the public key.

#### Private Key

Every bitcoin address has a public key and a corresponding private key, together they are called a keypair. If you have access to both the public and private key, you effectively control the funds in the address. As with HD wallets there are also keypairs that control _branches_ in the hierarchical tree of the wallet, and at the very top is the extended keypair (x-pub and x-prv for short) that control all the addresses in the wallet.

The private key is a 64 hexadecimal (or 256 if described in binary 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs) character string generated by the encryption algorithm. They look something like this in hexadecimal form:

`5KYZdUEo39z3FPrtuX2QbbwGnNP5zTd7yyr2SC1j299sBCnWjss`

Or for the extended private key:

`xprv9zrji5mK3nb4RbuR2ZYFtyzK3gn78KnEzkNP4ZxwwPPwcgQQVZqnjTMAGxmmM3jpmfsthQUtfD9iYPvnaqwejCjcyEswLqEhX4LPKNFUXT5`

#### The Lightning Network

The [lightning network](https://lightning.network/) extends bitcoin with payment channels to increase transaction speed and lower costs. It is becoming widely adopted and accepted as the preferred way to scale bitcoin.

#### Lightning Invoices

Users of the lightning network use a lightning invoice to request a payment. It is defined by [BOLT 11](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md) and includes an amount to be paid, destination of the payment, and an optional message. Unlike bitcoin addresses, lightning invoice‚Äôs expire after a set amount of time. By default, this is set to 60 minutes.

#### Passphrase

A passphrase can be added to the [recovery phrase](https://bitcoin.design/guide/glossary/#recovery-phrase) for extra security. Technically, all recovery phrases have a passphrase. If it‚Äôs not set by the user, an empty string (‚Äú‚Äù) will be used by default. Using the recovery phrase with or without the user-defined passphrase will recover two DIFFERENT wallets. Passphrases are sometimes referred to as the password, the extra word, or the 13th/25th word.

#### Custodial Wallet

A custodial wallet is a wallet wherein the user‚Äôs private keys are held by a third party, such as an exchange. The third party has full control over the user‚Äôs funds, while the user only has permission to send and receive bitcoin.

The third party is responsible for providing a backup to the wallet in case the user forgets their login information. A custodial wallet is subject to the security practices of the third party, which reduces the users responsibility, but creates an increased risk to the seed phrase and the keys stored by the wallet if the third party is hacked.

#### Non-Custodial Wallet

Non-custodial wallets give the user full control over their funds and the associated private keys. By using a non-custodial wallet, a user is their own bank; they can initiate transactions, and are responsible for the security of their wallet, including protection of their seed phrase, which can be used to restore their wallet if it‚Äôs lost or compromised.

<summary>mSats</summary>

mSats are each 1/1000 (a thousandth) of a satoshi. A satoshi is the smallest unit for bitcoin, but lightning can transact with even smaller units while channels are open. The amount is [rounded down](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnwire/msat.go#L22-L24) to the nearest satoshi when the channel is closed and broadcast to the blockchain to adhere to bitcoin's limit.

## FAQ‚Äôs

***

#### Why do Lightning Invoices Expire?

Why do invoices expire? If invoices had no expiry, recipients would likely run into memory / storage issues as the number of locally stored preimages grows with each payment attempt.

#### What is a Lightning Network channel?

A Lightning Network channel is a peer-to-peer payment channel that enables instant and low-cost transactions between two parties.

#### Do I need to run a Lightning Network node to use the network?

Nope, you don't need to run a node to use the Lightning Network. You can simply use a lightning wallet app to send and receive payments.

#### **How do I open a Lightning Network channel?**

Open a channel by sending a small amount of Bitcoin to another node or wallet, which serves as a deposit for the channel.

#### **What Are Some Popular Lightning Network wallets?**

Some popular Lightning Network wallets include Bluewallet, Lightning Lab's Lightning Wallet, Muun, Wallet of Satoshi, Zeus Wallet and Breez.

#### **What is a "channel reserve" and how does it affect my onboarding experience?**

Channel reserve is the amount of Bitcoin required to open a payment channel. Higher reserves can make it harder to find nodes and open channels.

#### **What is the difference between a Non-custodial & Custodial wallet**

_Also known as unhosted / self-hosted / hosted wallet._

A non-custodial wallet-application implies that the private key and/or recovery phrase is in full control of the end-user. This means that transactions can never be made without the user‚Äôs direct action. It also means that should the user forget or misplace their recovery phrase, wallet-application makers cannot help restore access to the funds in the bitcoin wallet.&#x20;

With a custodial wallet-application, the users are not exposed to and in charge of securing the recovery phrase. Often custodial wallet-applications require users to sign in with their email and password. Users must trust the wallet-application makers to secure their recovery phrase and bitcoin. With a custodial wallet-application, the makers of it are technically in control of their users‚Äô funds. Most exchanges give users custodial wallets.

#### Hot Wallet vs Cold Wallet

#### **Hot / Cold wallet** [**#**](https://bitcoin.design/guide/glossary/wallet/#hot--cold-wallet)

_Hot_ and _cold_ describe a wallet in terms of being connected to the internet. Where a hot wallet is connected to the internet, a cold wallet is not. The idea is that a cold wallet is less susceptible to third-party theft over the internet. Most software wallet-application would be seen as hot (although some can be used just for signing on a device not connected to the internet), and most hardware wallet-application would be seen as cold (although they are sometimes connected for signing purposes).

#### **What should I do if my Lightning transaction fails while trying to pay someone?**

Lightning Network transactions can fail for a few common reasons. The most frequent one is usually just not having enough funds in your channel to cover the payment. Make sure you've got enough money in the account you're sending from and don't forget to factor in the network fees (\~2% of the total amount you are trying to send).

Another common issue is the transaction not being able to find a route to the recipient's Lightning node. If that happens, just try again a few minutes later.

The Lightning Network is still evolving, so some failed transactions are normal. But those two things - insufficient funds and routing problems - tend to be the main culprits when a Lightning payment doesn't go through.
