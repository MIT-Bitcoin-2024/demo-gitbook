### Acknowledgment

We draw inspiration from some of the best examples of bug bounty program Code of Conducts, such as the [HackerOne Disclosure Guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines) and the [Bugcrowd Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/). We appreciate their efforts in creating safe and inclusive bug bounty communities.

### Let's Build Together

By following this Code of Conduct, we can foster a collaborative and respectful community that empowers Bitcoin developers to contribute to the Lightning Bounties bug bounty platform. Together, let's create a space where everyone feels welcome, supported, and encouraged to make meaningful contributions.
