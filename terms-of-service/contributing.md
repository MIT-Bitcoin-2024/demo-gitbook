## üß™ How to Test üë®‚Äçüî¨

1. **Fork the Repository and Clone it**
   * Fork the repository on GitHub.
   * Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
2. **Modify the Code**
   * Open the `src/main.py` file and make the desired changes to reflect your modifications.
3. **Generate a Lightning Invoice**
   * Generate a lightning invoice for the payment.
   * Copy the invoice string into the `reward.txt` file.
4. **Commit and Submit a Pull Request**
   * Add and commit your changes to the local repository.
   * Submit a pull request to the base repository.
5. **Pay the Invoice**
   * A GitHub action will be triggered to request a "dust" payment from you (the contributor) to the base repository (the owner).
   * Choose the action that says "Please pay the invoice: lnbc10n1..." (not the one that says "Extracted values:...").
   * Wait for the payment confirmation.
   * Once the payment is confirmed, you'll receive a message saying "Thank you for your payment!"
6. **Request a Reviewer**
   * Ask for a reviewer to review your pull request.
   * Choose either Enrique or Will for this test.
7. **Review and Analysis**
   * After a few seconds, a new action will run.
   * It will first say "Payment has been received, sit tight, running openai query."
   * Approximately 30 seconds later, it will return with a summary of your changes and a security vulnerability analysis.
8. **Merging the Pull Request**
   * We'll keep an eye out for your pull request and attempt to merge it for you. As a contributor, you don't have the power to merge it yourself.

**Alternatively:** If you prefer to replicate our work in your own repository:

* Copy the contents of the `.github/` directory into your repository.
* Modify the `main.py` file accordingly.
* Set up the following secrets in your repository settings:
  * `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  * `PAY_INVOICE_KEY` (admin key for LNBits)
  * `WALLET_API_KEY` (invoice/read key for LNBits)
  * `WALLET_BASE_URL` (URL for your LNBits instance)  &#x20;
